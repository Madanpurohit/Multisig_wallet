# Multisig_wallet
In this project, I build a Multisig Wallet Smart Contract. A multisig wallet is a wallet where multiple "signatures" or approvals are needed for an outgoing transfer to take place. As an example, I could create a multisig wallet with me and my 2 friends. I configure the wallet such that it requires at least 2 of us to sign any transfer before it is valid. Anyone can deposit funds into this wallet. But as soon as we want to spend funds, it requires 2/3 approvals.
